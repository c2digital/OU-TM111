# TM111 - Part 2 - Maths
  
## Exponents
- The little number next that denots how many times a number is multiplied by itself. 
- Such as m3 for cubed. A4 = A x A x A x A
- Exponents can also be negative, zero or fractional
- Any number (except 0) to the power of zero is just 1

## Kilobytes vs Kilobits
- Kilobyte = 1024 bits
- KB etc are often used for the storing of data (eg. my USB stick hold 16Gb)
- kb etc are often used for the transmission of data (eg. my broadband is 500mbs)
- Capital K = 2 to the power of 10 = 1024
- Lowercase k = 10 to the power of 3 = 1000
