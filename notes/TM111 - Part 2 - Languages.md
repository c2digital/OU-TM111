# TM111 - Part 2 - Languages

## Base 2 (Binary)
- A single binary digit is a bit (contraction of **BI**nary and digi**T**)
- A binary can be either true or false
- Every time the length of bits are increased by one, the number of possible values double (exponentially)

## Base 10 (Decimal)
- 0 to 9
- Uses 'weighted columns'. The number in each column is multiplied by the weight to get the total (eg. a '4' in a column with a weighting of '100' is 400)
