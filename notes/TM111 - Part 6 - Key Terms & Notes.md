# TM111 - Part 6 - Key Terms & Notes

## Key Terms

- ** =** 
- **Accssibility =** having equal access regardless of people pysical or developmental abilities or impairments
- **Assistive Technology =** enables users with disabilities to gain access to the web usch as screen magnifiers, screen readers or speech recognition
- **HCI =** Human Computer Interaction
- **Interaction Design =** the study of how people interact with each other through technology
- **Interface =** a "shared boundry" between the user and the computer
- **Technocentric =** machine centered
- **Universal Usability =** usable by all
- **User Centered Design (UCD) =** users know best their needs. Ask them.


## Notes

- Readability and ease of understanding vary with context (time/place) and with people (languages/cultures)
- HCI arose from the attempt to shift from the machine centered form of representation (binary) to human-centered.
- Match the tech to the person. The interface needs to be right as early as possible.
- For HCI designers, interaction is conceived as a feedback loop arising from the flow of info from a person to machine. "The mouse hardware registered a move 4 pixels to the left. The cursor has updated to 4 pixels to the left" looped until the user reaches the button etc.
- The users model (understanding) is goal orientated. "I moved the mouse and clicked the button"
- UI: User <-> UI <-> Software/Hardware
- A UI usually consists of inputs (buttons) and outputs (LED screens etc) for two way communication
- UI is technocrated where the computer is assumed but the user has to be specified
- Separability using interfaces allows the two sides of an interface to evolve and change without affecting the other side
- GUI often use metaphors. A calculator looks like a calculator, dragging a document to the bin deletes its etc
- The first graphical web browser appears in 1993
- User interfaces should be designed to enable users to interact effecively with computer-based devices
- Bad design can result in the loss of business
- Designing a good UI requires understanding the users, their tasks and the contexts of their use
- Design principles:-
  - Affordance - refers to the attributes of an object that indicate how it should be used (think push plates vs handles on doors). Affordance should be intuitive (in this context, what feels familiar).
    - All elements of an interface must have good affordance
    - Should be designed so that it is obvious how to use it
  - Perceivability - refers to making it clear what an interface element is used for. This could be by using familiar icons or text labels. (Think lift button arrows). The positioning and size of elements also influence the perceivability (the big button for 'next' etc).
    - All elements should have good perceivability
    -What is the goal to using the element. Can icons be used, is there a standard symbol for the goal>
  - Feedback - refers to an indication that something has happened. It could be rapid or continuous. Eg. clicking a button should have feedback so the user doesn't keep on clicking. A related principe is 'feel forwardward' whereby the user should know what to expect when they take an action.
    - All elements should provide adequate feedback in response to a users actions
    - What information could be sent back to the user? Visual, audio, physical
  - Contraints & Flexiblity
    - Contraints:-
      - Limiting the possible actions to avoid errors or inapproraite inputs
      - Could be physical like greyed out boxes or conventional colours (red for no, green for yes)
      - Eg. the submit button being disabled on a form until all fields completed
    - Flexibility:-
      - The idea of allowing more than one way to do a task
      - The system should include a level of tolerance to error by the user
- User Centered Design:-
  - Early focus on users and their tasks. Interview, observe and record users in action
  - Empirial measurements (eg. of user errors when using the UI)
  - Iterations of designs incorporating user feedback
- Usabulity and Accessiblity
  - A good interface is one that is easy to use and understand.
  - For an interface to be usable it must be perceived as such by the people using it
  - An effective design means the users are able to accomplish their goals accurately and completely
  - An efficent design means the users are able to accomplish their goals with minimum effort and time
- Basic principles for accessibility:-
  - Allow the user to select text size and fore/background colours
  - Provide equivalent visual and auditory content and interface elements
  - Provide compatability with assistive tech such as screen readers
  - Allow access to all functionality from keyboard alone, do not require the mouse
  - Support efficent navigation by providing context and orientation information
