# TM111 - Part 2

## Key Terms
- **Ubqiuity =**
- **Cloud =**
- **Programmable Computer =** A computer for which the instructions can be changed
- **Data =** The plural term for entered, returned or stored by a computer
- **Datum =** A single item of data 
- **Turing Test =** A test created by Alan Turing to test if a computer was 'able to think'. Asks fi the computer can have a conversation that could convince a human it was talking to another human. As of today this has not been achieved.
- **Transistor =** A tiny crystal of silicon (few mm) that can conduct electric and act as a switch by blocking or allow the electricity to conduct.
- **Integrated Circuit =** (aka. 'chip')
- **Terminals =** computer terminals (keyboard & monitor) connected to a computer via telephone. One computer would support multiple terminals across the country.

## Notes

- The first computers were extremely heavey, occupied entire buildings and were rare, less than 100 in the 1950s
- The power of a 1950s computer can now fit on a silicone chip that you can barely see with the naked eye
- Estimated to be around 2 billion personal computers in the world today
- Generally agreed to have been 4 generations of personal computers
- Gen 1 (1940s)...
  - Depends on what you define as a personal computer. Some might say this includes mechanical devices used to solved maths, including the Greek Antikytheria (astromical clock) and the abacus
  - For this course, Gen 1 starts with *programmable* computers which appeared around WW2 (1940s)
  - A programmable computer can add two numbers which can be changed as required (ie. program new numbers to be computed)
  - At the heart of all modern computers are electric switches, which can either be 'on' or 'off'. These can be grouped together to create binary values
  - The key to a good computer is the ability to have many switches that can be toggled quickly
  - First gen machines includes:
    - *Colossus*: A series of machines created at Bletchley Park in England during WW2. Used to break German codes. They were large and used expensive valves as the switches, which had a limited life, large and used alot of electricity. It was fged paper tape with punched holes and would output to an electric typewritter.
    - *ENIAC*: "Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer". The first general purpose machine used by the US military. Also used value technology. Programmed using plugs and wires. 
- Gen 2 (1950s)
  - Used transistors instead of vacuum tubes. There were small, cheaper, faster and used less electricity than the tubes.
  - Still expensive to buy and maintain with a starting price of around $85,000.
  - Often referred to as a mainframe, with the size of a cabinet.
  - Used punched cards to input data
  - A new smaller transistor based computer became popular in the 1960s called the 'minicomputer'. About the size of a wardrobe and cost around $16,000.
- Gen 3
  - Defined by the emergence of the integrated circuit (IC) which appeared in the mid-60s
  - Several components were placed on the same crystal of silicon rather than one per crystal. This resulted in a faster component with a lower price
  - Keyboards started to be used instead of punch cards and monitors for the output (known as a 'terminal')
  - Multiple terminals across the country would be connected to one computer via telephone.
  - First emergence of 'floppy disks' for storing data - making it portable for the first time
