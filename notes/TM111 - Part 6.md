# TM111 - Part 6

## Key Terms

- ** =** 
- **HCI =** Human Computer Interaction
- **Interaction Design =** the study of how people interact with each other through technology
- **Interface =** a "shared boundry" between the user and the computer
- **Technocentric =** machine centered

## Notes

- Readability and ease of understanding vary with context (time/place) and with people (languages/cultures)
- HCI arose from the attempt to shift from the machine centered form of representation (binary) to human-centered.
- Match the tech to the person. The interface needs to be right as early as possible.
- For HCI designers, interaction is conceived as a feedback loop arising from the flow of info from a person to machine. "The mouse hardware registered a move 4 pixels to the left. The cursor has updated to 4 pixels to the left" looped until the user reaches the button etc.
- The users model (understanding) is goal orientated. "I moved the mouse and clicked the button"
- UI: User <-> UI <-> Software/Hardware
- A UI usually consists of inputs (buttons) and outputs (LED screens etc) for two way communication
- UI is technocrated where the computer is assumed but the user has to be specified
- Separability using interfaces allows the two sides of an interface to evolve and change without affecting the other side
- GUI often use metaphors. A calculator looks like a calculator, dragging a document to the bin deletes its etc
- The first graphical web browser appears in 1993
