# TM111 - Part 3 - Key Terms

- ** =**
- **Amplitude =** maximum displacement. For sound this will determine how loud it is. Measured from zero to the peak or from zero to the trough.
- **Analogue =** Defined as 'a thing that is comparable to another'. A contingous values as opposed to the discrete values of a digital signal.
- **Binary Word =** a set of given number of bits
- **Bitmap =** a coding scheme that allocate a binary code to each pixel to define its colour and brightness (often the larger format, not suitable for web due to file sizes)
- **Compression =** converting a digital file to a new file that uses considerbly fewer bits without significantly degrading the quality of the original content
- **Compression Ratio =** Size of uncompressed / size of the compressed (eg: 10MB / 2MB = 5:1)
- **Continguous Value =** a value that is measured
- **Cycle (waveforms)=** the time between adjacent peaks or troughs.
- **Discrete Value=** a value that can be counted
- **Digital Media =** the tools we used to create media (text/image/audio) and the idea of communicating (shring) them via the internet
- **Echo (sound) =** caused by the sound bouncing off a surface and returning. This will be recorded again as a slight delay
- **File Format =** an agreed-upom way of oraganising and storing binary data
- **Frequency =** the number of cycles in a given time period (usually one second)
- **Hertz =** 1Hz = one cycle per second (ie. the period between two adjacent peaks or two adjacent troughs is 1 second).
- **Pressure Wave =** a regular pattern of high and low pressure regions
- **Reverberation (sound) =** caused by sound repeatidly bouncing off a surface in a way that makes it impossible to differentiate from the original. Combines with the original sound to create a new sound - often referred to as 'adding body' to the sound.
- **Sample Rate =** the number of times per second a sample is taken
- **Sound =** the ears intepretation of vibrations in the air (or water etc). An analogue signal.
- **Sound sample =** As images can be split into pixels, a sound waveform can be split into 'samples'
- **Vector Graphic =** Instead of storing pixel information, stores information about the shapes in an image. Most appropriate where the graphic is made up of regular shapes (such as in games). Not useful for photos or videos.
