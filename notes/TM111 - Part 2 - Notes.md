# TM111 - Part 2 -  Notes

## Computer Generations
- The first computers were extremely heavey, occupied entire buildings and were rare, less than 100 in the 1950s
- The power of a 1950s computer can now fit on a silicone chip that you can barely see with the naked eye
- Estimated to be around 2 billion personal computers in the world today
- Generally agreed to have been 4 generations of personal computers
- **Gen 1 (1940s)...**
  - Depends on what you define as a personal computer. Some might say this includes mechanical devices used to solved maths, including the Greek Antikytheria (astromical clock) and the abacus
  - For this course, Gen 1 starts with *programmable* computers which appeared around WW2 (1940s)
  - A programmable computer can add two numbers which can be changed as required (ie. program new numbers to be computed)
  - At the heart of all modern computers are electric switches, which can either be 'on' or 'off'. These can be grouped together to create binary values
  - The key to a good computer is the ability to have many switches that can be toggled quickly
  - First gen machines includes:
    - *Colossus*: A series of machines created at Bletchley Park in England during WW2. Used to break German codes. They were large and used expensive valves as the switches, which had a limited life, large and used alot of electricity. It was fged paper tape with punched holes and would output to an electric typewritter.
    - *ENIAC*: "Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer". The first general purpose machine used by the US military. Also used value technology. Programmed using plugs and wires. 
- **Gen 2 (1950s)**
  - Used transistors instead of vacuum tubes. There were small, cheaper, faster and used less electricity than the tubes.
  - Still expensive to buy and maintain with a starting price of around $85,000.
  - Often referred to as a mainframe, with the size of a cabinet.
  - Used punched cards to input data
  - A new smaller transistor based computer became popular in the 1960s called the 'minicomputer'. About the size of a wardrobe and cost around $16,000.
- **Gen 3 (1960s)**
  - Defined by the emergence of the integrated circuit (IC) which appeared in the mid-60s
  - Several components were placed on the same crystal of silicon rather than one per crystal. This resulted in a faster component with a lower price
  - Keyboards started to be used instead of punch cards and monitors for the output (known as a 'terminal')
  - Multiple terminals across the country would be connected to one computer via telephone.
  - First emergence of 'floppy disks' for storing data - making it portable for the first time
- **Gen 4**
  - With the introduction of microprocessors, personal ownership of computers became possible.
  - Early models were referred to as microcomputers (or just 'micros')
  - Four types of personal computers; Small personal computers for home use (games, word processing etc), larger workstations for intensive applications like graphics, minicomputers with terminal computers and the expensive and bulky mainframes/supercomputers used by governments and universities

## Moore's Law
- Gordon Moore (founder of Intel) made a prediction in 1965 that the density of electronic components on an IC silicon chip would double every year for the next 10 years
- He was close, it actually doubled every two years.
- At some point it moved from being a prediction to the industry target.
- Intels Core M processor (2015) contains 1.3billion transistors measure just 14nm (the flu virus is 20nm!)
- In recent years the law has started to faulter as the benefits of reducing size have decreased whilst the costs of doing so have increased

## Embedded Computers
- The most common kind of computer
- Part of a large device and is designed to carry out a specialised function
- Also known as micro controller or microprocessor
