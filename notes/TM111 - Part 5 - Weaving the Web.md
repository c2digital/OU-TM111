# TM111 - Part 5 - Weaving the Web

This part is all about HTML, which I use frequently as a software developer. My notes will be light on this section.

## Key Terms
- **Delimiting =** concept of marking a start and end (ie. using opening and closing tags)
- **Domain Name =** top level domain. Eg. google.com
- **Explicit Markup =** Writing all the html character by character
- **Hexadecimal =**Takes all possible 4-bit binary words and codes them into sixteen symbols (0-F)
- **XML =** Extensible Markup Language. A way in which information ca be marked up and structured
- ** =** 

## Notes
- The web is a client-server system. The computer that serves the information is the server. The browser requesting the information is the client.
- The whole web address is known as a 'Uniform Resource Locator' (URL)
- A URL is made up of...
  - Scheme: defines how the client should form its requests to access the server. Usually http or https
  - Host: the name of the server. This includes the domain name (google.com) and any subdomains (en.google.com).
  - Paths: the name of the file on the server. Typically with nested directors representated usins slashes. Eg /user/profile/123
- Webpages are put together using HTML (hypertext markup language)
- HTML5 is the latest version (at current).
- XML
  - A way in which information ca be marked up and structured
  - Called extensible as the language can be extended by its users as users can define their own tags
  - Allows content of a document to be shared in an agreed way
