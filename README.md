# About This Repo

I am using this repo to store my study notes for my BSc "Computing with Electronic Engineering" course.

The notes are created using the Notable app (https://notable.app/) and are uploaded here to be stored for whenever I need them, no matter what device I am using.

## Why store notes in Git?

I prefer a simple notepad style app for my notes - and this way I won't lose them...

The Notable app also includes some nice features including tags and supports markdown, so I can concentrate on the typing rather than finding the right buttons for the style or the perfect font.

## Can we share?

You are more than welcome to clone and use my notes for your own studies!

They may have the odd typo and will be tailored to my specific course but I hope you can find them useful (and good luck in your own studies!).
