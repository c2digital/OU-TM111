# About This Repo

I am using this repo to store my study notes for my BSc "Computing with Electronic Engineering" course.

The notes are created using the Notable app (https://notable.app/) and are uploaded here to be stored for whenever I need them (or if you need them - feel free to clone and use them for your own studies!)

## Why store notes in Git?

I prefer a simple notepad style app for my notes - and this way I won't lose them...

The Notable app also includes some nice features including tags and supports markdown, so I can concentrate on the typing rather than finding the right buttons for the style or the perfect font.
